# Database Migration : Code-Along

## Learning Goals

- Use Flask-Migrate to manage changes to a database schema.
- Create migrations for different types of schema modifications.
- **Upgrade** a schema from an old version to a newer version.
- Roll back, or **downgrade** a schema from a newer version to an older one.

---

## Key Vocab

- **Schema**: the blueprint of a database. Describes how data relates to other
  data in tables, columns, and relationships between them.
- **Schema Migration**: the process of moving a schema from one version to
  another.

---

## Introduction

In the previous lesson, we used Flask-Migrate (which uses Alembic behind the
scenes) to create an initial version of a database schema that defined a single
table. But we often need to make additional changes to a schema after it has
been defined. For example, we may need to add new tables, add new columns to
existing tables, rename columns, add or change column constraints, etc.
Flask-Migrate is a powerful tool that can generate migrations for many of the
common changes we might make to a database schema, including:

- Creating and dropping tables.
- Creating and dropping columns.
- Most indexing tasks.
- Renaming keys.

That being said, there are certain tasks that Flask-Migrate can help us with but
cannot carry out on its own:

- Table name changes.
- Column name changes.
- Adding, removing, or changing unnamed constraints.
- Converting Python data types that are not supported by the database.

In this lesson, we will explore various types of schema migrations and how to
roll back, or downgrade, migrations that were unnecessary or went awry.

To check out the full list of supported commands, make sure you follow the setup
instructions and then type `flask db --help` in the terminal.

---

## Setup

This lesson is a code-along, so fork and clone the repo.

Run `pipenv install` to install the dependencies and `pipenv shell` to enter
your virtual environment before running your code.

```console
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
```

Change into the `server` directory and configure the `FLASK_APP` and
`FLASK_RUN_PORT` environment variables:

```console
$ cd server
$ export FLASK_APP=app.py
$ export FLASK_RUN_PORT=5555
```

## Initial Migration - Employee Model

```text
└── server
    ├── app.py
    ├── models.py
    └── testing
        └── codegrade_test.py
```

The `server` directory contains `models.py`, which defines an `Employee` model:

```py
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from sqlalchemy import MetaData

# contains definitions of tables and associated schema constructs
metadata = MetaData()

# create the Flask SQLAlchemy extension
db = SQLAlchemy(metadata=metadata)

# define a model class by inheriting from db.Model.


class Employee(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'employees'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    salary = db.Column(db.Integer)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'<Employee {self.id}, {self.name}, {self.salary}>'

```

Let's perform an initial migration to create the database `app.db` with an
`employees` table as described by the `Employee` model.

Make sure you are in the `server` directory, then enter the following commands:

```console
$ flask db init
```

```console
$ flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
```

At this point, you will see a new migration script `###_initial_migration.py`
show up in the `server/migrations/versions` directory (your version number will
be different):

```text
.
├── app.py
├── instance
│   └── app.db
├── migrations
│   ├── README
│   ├── alembic.ini
│   ├── env.py
│   ├── script.py.mako
│   └── versions
│       └── 15537423c56d_initial_migration.py
├── models.py
└── testing
    └── codegrade_test.py
```

As a reminder, the `###_initial_migration.py` script contains two functions
`upgrade()` and `downgrade()`. We can see the `upgrade()` function will create
the `employees` table, while the `downgrade()` script drops it.

```py
def upgrade():
    # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###
    op.create_table('employees',
    sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),
    sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
    sa.Column('salary', sa.Integer(), nullable=True),
    sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint('id')
    )
    # ### end Alembic commands ###


def downgrade():
    # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###
    op.drop_table('employees')
    # ### end Alembic commands ###
```

Let's execute the `upgrade()` function to create the table.

```console
$ flask db upgrade head
```

Open the database file `server/instance/app.db` using SQLite Viewer (or any
other SQLite extension) and confirm the newly created `employees` table:

![initial migration creates empty employee table](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/7159/python-p4-v2-flask-sqlalchemy/initial.png)

Let's use the Flask shell to add a few employees:

```console
$ flask shell
>>> from models import db, Employee
>>> db.session.add( Employee(name = "Kai Uri", salary = 89000))
>>> db.session.add( Employee(name = "Alena Lee", salary = 125000))
>>> db.session.commit()
>>> Employee.query.all()
[<Employee 1, Kai Uri, 89000>, <Employee 2, Alena Lee, 125000>]
>>> exit()
```

## Second Migration - Department model

In this next step, we will update `models.py` to add a `Department` model. We'll
intensionally make a mistake in assigning the singular table name `department`,
then see how to fix this in a subsequent migration.

Update `models.py` to add the `Department` class as shown:

```py
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from sqlalchemy import MetaData

# contains definitions of tables and associated schema constructs
metadata = MetaData()

# create the Flask SQLAlchemy extension
db = SQLAlchemy(metadata=metadata)

# define a model class by inheriting from db.Model.


class Employee(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'employees'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    salary = db.Column(db.Integer)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'<Employee {self.id}, {self.name}, {self.salary}>'


class Department(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'department'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    address = db.Column(db.String)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'<Department {self.id}, {self.name}, {self.address}>'
```

Adding a new model means we need to add a new table to the database.

Since we've already inserted some rows into the `employees` table, we **don't
want to delete** the database and recreate the initial migration because we
would lose that data (imagine we inserted millions of rows rather than just
two).

We will migrate the database schema by generating a second migration script to
add the new `department` table, while leaving the existing `employees` table
unmodified. Run `flask db migrate` with a descriptive message that explains the
new change to the schema:

```console
$ flask db migrate -m 'add Department'
```

A new migration script appears in the `migrations/versions` directory (once
again, your version numbers will be different):

```text
.
├── app.py
├── instance
│   └── app.db
├── migrations
│   ├── README
│   ├── alembic.ini
│   ├── env.py
│   ├── script.py.mako
│   └── versions
│       ├── 15537423c56d_initial_migration.py
│       └── 51f20aa4768b_add_department.py
├── models.py
└── testing
    └── codegrade_test.py
```

Take a look at the `###_add_department.py` migration script. The `upgrade()` and
`downgrade()` functions will add and drop the `department` table. Notice also
the `down_revision` variable references the version id of the initial migration
script.

```py
"""add Department

Revision ID: 51f20aa4768b
Revises: 15537423c56d
Create Date: 2023-08-02 17:33:01.228058

"""
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa

# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision = '51f20aa4768b'
down_revision = '15537423c56d'
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None

def upgrade():
    # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###
    op.create_table('department',
    sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),
    sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
    sa.Column('address', sa.String(), nullable=True),
    sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint('id')
    )
    # ### end Alembic commands ###

def downgrade():
    # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###
    op.drop_table('department')
    # ### end Alembic commands ###
```

Let's execute this most recent migration script to add the new table by
executing the `upgrade()` function. Recall that `head` refers to the most recent
migration version. Type the following command to execute the
`###_add_department.py` script (i.e. the most recent version).

```console
$ flask db upgrade head
```

Confirm the new `department` table has been added to the database:

![department table added to database](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/7159/python-p4-v2-flask-sqlalchemy/add_department.png)

Now add some departments using Flask shell:

```console
$ flask shell
>>> from models import Department
>>> db.session.add( Department(name = "Payroll", address = "Building A, 4th Floor"))
>>> db.session.add( Department(name = "Human Resources", address = "Building C, 1st Floor"))
>>> db.session.commit()
>>> Department.query.all()
[<Department 1, Payroll, Building A, 4th Floor>, <Department 2, Human Resources, Building C, 1st Floor>]
>>> exit()
```

## Third Migration - Rename department table

Let's fix the error we made in naming the table. Edit `models.py` to change the
table name from `department` to `departments`:

```py
class Department(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'departments'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    address = db.Column(db.String)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'<Department {self.id}, {self.name}, {self.address}>'
```

This represents a necessary change to the schema. In SQL we would execute an
`ALTER TABLE` command. However, we can try to have Flask-Migrate do the work for
us.

Type the following to generate a new migration script:

```console
flask db migrate -m "rename department"
```

This results in a new script in `migrations/versions`:

```text
.
├── app.py
├── instance
│   └── app.db
├── migrations
│   ├── README
│   ├── alembic.ini
│   ├── env.py
│   ├── script.py.mako
│   └── versions
│       ├── 15537423c56d_initial_migration.py
│       ├── 1694ecedb24d_rename_department.py
│       └── 51f20aa4768b_add_department.py
├── models.py
└── testing
    └── codegrade_test.py
```

**DON'T run `flask db upgrade head` yet!**

It is always a good idea to check the migration script before performing a
migration. Open up the new migration script `###_rename_department.py`:

```py
"""rename department

Revision ID: 1694ecedb24d
Revises: 51f20aa4768b
Create Date: 2023-08-02 18:19:06.373953

"""
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa


# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision = '1694ecedb24d'
down_revision = '51f20aa4768b'
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None


def upgrade():
    # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###
    op.create_table('departments',
    sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),
    sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
    sa.Column('address', sa.String(), nullable=True),
    sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint('id')
    )
    op.drop_table('department')
    # ### end Alembic commands ###


def downgrade():
    # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###
    op.create_table('department',
    sa.Column('id', sa.INTEGER(), nullable=False),
    sa.Column('name', sa.VARCHAR(), nullable=False),
    sa.Column('address', sa.VARCHAR(), nullable=True),
    sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint('id')
    )
    op.drop_table('departments')
    # ### end Alembic commands ###

```

Notice the `upgrade()` function wants to drop the existing `department` table
and create a new `departments` table. This is not what we want since we already
added rows to the `department` table.

We want to rename the existing table, not drop and create a new one. In SQL, we
would use the `ALTER TABLE` statement. We can achieve the same thing by calling
the Alembic function `rename_table()`.

Edit the `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` functions as shown. The `rename_table()`
function takes two parameters, the old table name and the new table name:

```py
def upgrade():
    # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###
    op.rename_table('department', 'departments')
    # ### end Alembic commands ###


def downgrade():
    # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###
    op.rename_table('departments', 'department')
    # ### end Alembic commands ###
```

Save the file, then run the upgrade command:

```console
flask db upgrade head
```

Confirm the table has been renamed from `department` to `departments` and that
the 2 rows are still in the table:

![rename department table](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/7159/python-p4-v2-flask-sqlalchemy/rename_departments.png)

## Fourth Migration - Rename address column

We saw that Flask-Migrate generates correct migration code when we added a new
model `Department` to the schema. Flask-Migrate also generates correct code if
we add a new column to an existing model.

However,renaming a column will require a manual update to the migration script,
similar to renaming a table.

Let's rename the `address` column as `location`. Edit `models.py` to change the
attribute name (and update `__repr__`):

```py
class Department(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'departments'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    location = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'<Department {self.id}, {self.name} {self.location}>'
```

Generate a new migration script:

```console
flask db migrate -m "rename address"
```

```console
.
├── app.py
├── instance
│   └── app.db
├── migrations
│   ├── README
│   ├── alembic.ini
│   ├── env.py
│   ├── script.py.mako
│   └── versions
│       ├── 15537423c56d_initial_migration.py
│       ├── 1694ecedb24d_rename_department.py
│       ├── 51f20aa4768b_add_department.py
│       └── 76f31678b786_rename_address.py
├── models.py
└── testing
    └── codegrade_test.py
```

Open the new `###_rename_address.py` file to see the auto-generated `upgrade()`
and `downgrade()` functions:

```py
def upgrade():
    # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###
    with op.batch_alter_table('departments', schema=None) as batch_op:
        batch_op.add_column(sa.Column('location', sa.String(), nullable=True))
        batch_op.drop_column('address')

    # ### end Alembic commands ###


def downgrade():
    # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###
    with op.batch_alter_table('departments', schema=None) as batch_op:
        batch_op.add_column(sa.Column('address', sa.VARCHAR(), nullable=True))
        batch_op.drop_column('location')
```

The `batch_alter_table` function is called to execute the `add_column()` and
`drop_column()` functions as a transaction.

But we don't want to drop the column at all since that will cause us to lose the
data in the 2 existing rows! Instead, we will rename the column from `address`
to `location` using the `alter_column()` function. Edit the migration script to
call `alter_column()` as shown:

```py

def upgrade():
    # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###
    op.alter_column('departments', 'address',  new_column_name='location')
    # ### end Alembic commands ###


def downgrade():
    # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###
    op.alter_column('departments', 'location',  new_column_name='address')
    # ### end Alembic commands ###
```

Now we can upgrade the schema to rename the column from `address` to `location`:

```console
flask db upgrade head
```

![rename column](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/7159/python-p4-v2-flask-sqlalchemy/rename_address.png)

## Downgrading/Reverting a migration

Sometimes we might want to undo a schema migration and return to a previous
version.

This was the order of the migration versions that we performed:

1. ###\_initial_migration.py
2. ###\_add_department.py
3. ###\_rename_department.py
4. ###\_rename_address.py

Suppose we decide to revert the column name from `location` back to `address`.
We would like to undue the most recent changes performed by
`###_rename_address.py` and return the schema to the state it was in the
previous version `###_rename_department.py`

Open the most recent version `###_rename_address.py` and look at the value of
the variable `down_revision`. Your number will be different:

```py
"""rename address

Revision ID: 76f31678b786
Revises: 1694ecedb24d
Create Date: 2023-08-02 18:52:31.603713

"""
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa


# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision = '76f31678b786'
down_revision = '1694ecedb24d'
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None


def upgrade():
    # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###
    op.alter_column('departments', 'address',  new_column_name='location')
    # ### end Alembic commands ###


def downgrade():
    # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###
    op.alter_column('departments', 'location',  new_column_name='address')
    # ### end Alembic commands ###

```

The `downgrade()` function will basically undo the column renaming and return us
to the previous version as defined by `down_revision`.

Execute the following command (substituting ### for the version number specified
by `down_version`):

```console
flask db downgrade ###
```

This should rename the `location` column back to `address`.

You may need to hit the refresh button to see that change:

![rename department table](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/7159/python-p4-v2-flask-sqlalchemy/rename_departments.png)

Note: You should also update `models.py` to rename the variable back to the
original `address` (and revert `__repr__`).

## Conclusion

You should now have a basic idea of how to make a variety of changes to database
schemas using Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate and Alembic. If you'd like to know
more about what alembic can autogenerate and what it cannot, check out their

## Solution Code

The final version of `models.py`:

```py

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'<Employee {self.id}, {self.name}, {self.salary}>'

class Department(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'departments'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    address = db.Column(db.String)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'<Department {self.id}, {self.name}, {self.address}>'
```
